## Section 1

This is an early foray into learning more about Latin American writers with materials held in Princeton University Library Special and Distinct Collections. The project began with  a list of collections  (and their linked finding aids) produced in a research guide by Fernando Acosta-Rodríguez, Librarian for Latin American, Iberian and Latino Studies at Princeton University.

Rather than beginning this project with a deep dive into the archives, I decided to experiment with building a new corpus by starting with author names listed in the collection title and then linking these information from Wikidata to those names. What resulted was a small, yet useful dataset with demographic information about some of the Latin American writers present in the archives here..
